üìå Motivation: Why NER and POS tagging matter in Finance

In the financial sector, **documents like contracts, regulatory filings, and earnings reports** 
are dense with important information‚Äînames of parties, legal obligations, amounts, dates, and conditions. 
Extracting this information is critical for:

    üìâ Risk assessment (e.g., liabilities, obligations, exposure)
    üßæ Contract summarization (e.g., who owes what to whom)
    üîç Compliance checks (e.g., detecting location-based restrictions)
    üíπ Downstream analytics (e.g., linking entities to market behavior)
    üëÄ Sentiment analysis (e.g., towards particular product or company)


To perform such tasks, we must first identify and extract entities from the document.
To do this, we can either employ an army of interns or graduates or train ML models to do it.
More and more it's the latter - AI - being employed to do such tasks, with a human verifying
mission critical results. Step through this tutorial to learn the concepts behind POS tagging
and Named Entity Recognition. Try out the interactive features to tune and try out different models
and finally, upload your own documents to recognize the entities in it.

#### ‚úçÔ∏è POS Tagging as a Foundation for Entity Extraction.

Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging assigns grammatical labels to sentences in a document:

    Nouns (NN, NNP): Names of people, companies, instruments
    Verbs (VB): Actions like "acquire", "transfer", "guarantee"
    Adjectives (JJ): Descriptors that modify nouns (e.g., ‚Äúsecured‚Äù, ‚Äúfloating‚Äù)

This is a crucial first step because:

    Proper nouns (NNP) are often names of people or organizations
    Noun phrases like "collateral agreement" or "parties to agreement" carry semantic weight
    Verbs signal events (e.g., ‚Äúterminated‚Äù, ‚Äúentered into‚Äù, ‚Äúassigned‚Äù)

Remember those **syntax trees** exercise from English lectures in middle school? We drew lines  
sentence to break it down into constituent parts. First we would break the sentence into subject 
(noun phrase) and predicate (verb phrase), and then iteratively break these into determiners, adjective, 
adverbs, etc. The end results looked like an upside down tree, with words at the leaves, each labeled 
with a part of speech.

A **treebank** is a manually annotated database where each word in a sentence is labeled with:

| **Universal Dependencies (UD)** | A modern, multilingual POS + dependency grammar project. |
| **Brown Corpus**    | One of the earliest corpora, used in NLTK. Simpler tagset. |

POS taggers are trained on these treebanks using various methods:

- üßÆ **Generative Models** (e.g., Maximum Entropy Markov Models)
- üîÄ **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) / LSTM**
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Modern Transformers / BERT-style models**

Each model learns to **predict the most likely tag** for a word based on its context and history.

These models are often evaluated on the same treebanks they were trained on, with metrics like 
**Precision, Recall, F1 Score**, and **Accuracy**. Here are the benchmarks from the Penn Treebank

st.markdown(r"""
In this task, we use a further labeled dataset introduced by [**Alvarado (2015)**](https://aclanthology.org/U15-1010.pdf) 
for Named Entity Recognition in the financial domain. The dataset consists of **eight financial agreements** 
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), totaling approximately **50,000 words**.
that were pre-tokenized and POS-tagged using **NLTK**. Under the hood, NLTK uses a tagger trained on the **Brown Corpus**, one of the earliest 
English treebanks.

These <word, POS> pairs were then manually-labelled with a NER tag by the authors. 
The dataset includes four named entity labels:
- `ORG`: Organization names (e.g., Barclays Capital)
- `LOC`: Locations (e.g., New York, California)
- `PER`: Person names (e.g., John Doe)
- `MISC`: Miscellaneous entities

In addition **IO format** is used to tag entities that span multiple tokens. Tokens that occur inside a span are
tagged with an I, and any tokens outside of any span of interest are labeled O.            

After tagging, token in the now dataset comes with:
- A word
- Its POS tag (from Brown tagset)
- Its **manually** labeled NER tag

Each token is annotated in **CoNLL format**, where it contains:
```<token> <POS tag> <NER label>```

An empty line separates each sentence.

This POS/NER information is a serves as the training set for the **ML model** we use for Named Entity Recognition.

st.markdown(r"""
Extracting named entities (like **Barclays**, **New York**, or **credit support annex**) is a fundamental task in NLP ‚Äî especially important in **financial documents** where even a single misidentified entity can cause major downstream errors.

One could try to write **manual rules** ("If a word is capitalized, it might be a person or company"), or use **dictionaries** of known names ‚Äî but this approach breaks down:
- New entities appear constantly (e.g., new companies, people)
- Context matters: "Apple" could be a fruit or a company
- Rules are brittle and hard to maintain

So instead, we use **Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)** ‚Äî a machine learning model specifically designed to handle **structured sequence prediction**, like tagging each word in a sentence with the right entity label.
""")

st.markdown("""
A **Conditional Random Field** is a type of probabilistic graphical model. It models the **conditional probability** of a sequence of labels (e.g., entity tags) given a sequence of observations (e.g., words and their features).

It‚Äôs particularly powerful because:
- It considers the **entire sequence context** (not just one word at a time)
- It can incorporate **handcrafted features** that encode useful heuristics
- It allows you to model **dependencies between tags** (e.g., if the previous tag is B-ORG, the next might be I-ORG)

Mathematically, the CRF assigns a score to each possible sequence of labels and normalizes it into a probability:

| `has_digits` | Word contains digits |
| `has_punct` | Word contains punctuation |
| `has_hyphen` | Word contains a hyphen |
| `is_upper` | All uppercase |
| `is_lower` | All lowercase |

| `stem` | Word stem (e.g., ‚Äúrunning‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúrun‚Äù) |
| `lemma` | Word lemma (e.g., ‚Äúran‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúrun‚Äù) |

Let's say we have the word **‚ÄúLloyds‚Äù** in a sentence.

  "has_capitals_inside": false,
  "has_digits": false,
  "has_punct": false,

Based on patterns across hundreds of such examples, the CRF learns which combinations of 
features predict entity types like ORG or PER.

- **Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression** treats each word independently
- **HMM** can model sequences but doesn't support custom features well
- **CRF** is the sweet spot ‚Äî it supports **sequence awareness** *and* **handcrafted features**

That's why it has been a go-to choice for NER tasks before deep learning took over ‚Äî and still performs very well when trained on domain-specific data.
