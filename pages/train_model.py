We follow the approach used by **[Alvarado (2015)](https://aclanthology.org/U15-1010.pdf)** of using  mixed training sets for niche domains.
The model is trained on CoNLL-2003 data which is POS tagged Reuters newswire data. We divide the 
financial documents data from 8 SEC filling into two parts - first 3 documents supplement the training
and the last 5 are used to evaluate and test.
