In this task, we use a further labeled dataset introduced by [**Alvarado (2015)**](https://aclanthology.org/U15-1010.pdf) 
for Named Entity Recognition in the financial domain. The dataset consists of **eight financial agreements** 
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), totaling approximately **50,000 words**.
that were pre-tokenized and POS-tagged using **NLTK**. Under the hood, NLTK uses a tagger trained on the **Brown Corpus**, one of the earliest 
English treebanks.

These <word, POS> pairs were then manually-labelled with a NER tag by the authors. 
The dataset includes four named entity labels:
- `ORG`: Organization names (e.g., Barclays Capital)
- `LOC`: Locations (e.g., New York, California)
- `PER`: Person names (e.g., John Doe)
- `MISC`: Miscellaneous entities

In addition **IO format** is used to tag entities that span multiple tokens. Tokens that occur inside a span are
tagged with an I, and any tokens outside of any span of interest are labeled O.            

After tagging, token in the now dataset comes with:
- A word
- Its POS tag (from Brown tagset)
- Its **manually** labeled NER tag

Each token is annotated in **CoNLL format**, where it contains:
```<token> <POS tag> <NER label>```

An empty line separates each sentence.

This POS/NER information is a serves as the training set for the **ML model** we use for Named Entity Recognition.

You'll notice:
- Proper nouns (NNP) often map to ORG, PER, or LOC.
- This structure makes the dataset suitable for a **CRF model**, where context and handcrafted features help improve NER performance.
